# Text Editor Starter Code
## description
This was a rather simple yet confusing challenge. It was pretty much exactly what the mini project was yet structured differently. It used the same node packages as well as functtions. I was vbery puzzled by the put fucntion we were required to make since it was not discssed or shown in the mini project. I did some digging online and found a few examples of how it worked. Overall this was a fun challenge and im excited to learn more.
## What I learned
- how to make a PWA
- How bundles are structured
- Purpose/ importance of service workers
